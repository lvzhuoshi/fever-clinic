We thank all those organizations and individuals around China who have been willing and able to report fever clinics data in as open and timely manner as possible. Our work aims to integrate information from across a myriad set of data sources. We collated all the data sources and pass them as excel files in the repository. Five researchers have contributed to the specific data added here and their names and details are listed below along with citations.
Please get in touch should you want to contribute line list data, have any questions or just want to say hi: zhuoshi@my.swjtu.edu.cn or guoqi@swjtu.edu.cn
We promote open collaboration among researchers and encourage users of these data make best efforts to collaborate with representatives of the groups that generated data and involve them in their analyses where appropriate. Please get in touch should you require more information.
